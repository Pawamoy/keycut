Helper tool to show and search shortcuts for your favorite programs.

KeyCut (for keyboard shortcut) is a command line tool
that helps you remembering the numerous keyboard shortcuts
of your favorite programs, both graphical and command line ones,
by allowing you to print them quickly in a console and search through them.

Shortcut data are provided by the `keycut-data`_ repository.

This repo contains the sources for a Python implementation of KeyCut.

It looks like this

The yellow parts are the one that matched a pattern using a regular expression.

Installation
============

::

    pip install keycut

Usage
=====

.. code:: bash

    python main.py bash

Show all bash shortcuts.

.. code:: bash

    python main.py bash proc

Show all bash shortcuts matching *proc* (in Category, Action, or Keys)

.. code:: bash

    python main.py --watch`

Will watch *$HOME/.keycut* file. Output a command in this file and KeyCut
will show the corresponding shortcuts (if available).

.. code:: bash

    python main.py --watch=thisFile

Same as before but change file path to absolute path of *thisFile*.

When you call it with --watch option, it will print on stdout two shell functions
that you can copy/paste in other shells:

.. code:: bash

    k() { echo "$@" > $HOME/.keycut; eval '"$@"'; }
    # Ask KeyCut to show corresponding shortcuts, then execute the command.

.. code:: bash

    kgrep() { echo "$@" > $HOME/.keycut; }
    # Just ask KeyCut to show corresponding shortcuts.

*$HOME/.keycut* will of course be replaced by the file you provided to --watch option.

You can then use these functions like this:

.. code:: bash

    k vim README.rst
    kgrep vim replace
    k htop
